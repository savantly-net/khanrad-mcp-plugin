description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "plan a project", "brainstorm a project", "plan a new app", "decompose a project into stories", "greenfield project planning", "break down an application idea", or wants to go from an application description to a set of Khanrad issues and stories.

# Khanrad Plan Project Skill

This skill takes a greenfield application description, guides the user through iterative refinement, decomposes the application into domains, generates stories and epics using parallel subagents, and populates a Khanrad board with tagged, prioritized issues.

## When This Skill Applies

- User has an application idea and wants to plan it out
- User wants to break down a project into implementable stories
- User asks to brainstorm, decompose, or plan a greenfield project
- User wants to go from a description to a Khanrad board full of issues
- User mentions "greenfield", "new project", "project planning", or "story generation"

## Key Concepts

- **Domain** — a bounded context or feature area within the application (e.g., `auth`, `payments`, `notifications`). Each domain becomes a tag prefix: `domain:<name>`.
- **Tag taxonomy** — issues are tagged with structured labels for filtering:
  - `domain:<name>` — feature area (e.g., `domain:auth`, `domain:orders`)
  - `phase:mvp` / `phase:v2` / `phase:future` — release phase
  - `type:epic` / `type:story` / `type:spike` — work type
  - `cross-cutting` — items spanning multiple domains
- **Parallel subagents** — each domain's stories are generated by an independent subagent running concurrently, then collected for user review.
- **Refinement loop** — the skill asks iterative questions to build a complete picture before generating stories. It never generates stories from a vague description alone.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Intake** — collect the application description and ask refining questions about users, workflows, constraints, integrations, and MVP scope.
2. **Decompose** — identify domains/bounded contexts and confirm with the user.
3. **Generate** — spawn parallel subagents (one per domain) to produce epics and stories.
4. **Review** — present stories grouped by domain, let the user refine, adjust priorities, and confirm the MVP cut.
5. **Populate** — create a Khanrad project and board, then create all approved issues with tags, priorities, and state organization.

## Output

A fully populated Khanrad board with issues organized by domain tags, release phase, priority, and board state (Backlog for MVP, Ice Box for future work).
